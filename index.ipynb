    "Limited access to safe drinking water affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Over 57 million Tanzanians are fighting to get access to clean water, life's most important resource. Access to clean, safe water is crucial for the health of Tanzanian households. Water is also critical to the development of the country because it is required for agricultural and industrial output. The issue of water supply in Tanzania is concerning, because while there is plenty of fresh water available throughout the country, there are several access issues with the country's water wells. There is a clear need to identify the non-functioning wells that are prohibiting citizens from exercising a core human right. Our model will enable government authorities to dentify which water wells require repairs and take immediate action to improve the quality of life for citizens in need."
